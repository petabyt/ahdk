# Ambarella Hack Development Kit
Unofficial documentation and hacks for Ambarella based cameras.  

[Extensive AmbaShell/Ambsh Documentation](ambsh.md)  

## Autoexec generator
In gen/, there is some code that generates autoexec.ash files that mess with  
the camera's memory.  

## Other
- Currently, I'm working with the Activeon DX, but I also have a Gopro Hero 3+.  
- Any help and/or questions are welcome.

# Goals
- Extensive Ambsh documentation
- Magic lantern like program (written in C)
- Quick introduction document to Ambarella software/hardware
- Ambsh interpreter
