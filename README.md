# Ambarella Hack Development Kit
Unofficial documentation and hacks for Ambarella based cameras.  

[Extensive AmbaShell/Ambsh Documentation](ambsh.md)  

## Autoexec generator
In gen/, there is some code that generates autoexec.ash files that inject  
assembly into the camera's memory.

# Goals
- Extensive Ambsh documentation
- Magic lantern like program (written in C)
- Quick introduction document to Ambarella software/hardware
- Ambsh interpreter/minimizer (with macros and stuff?) (parse/)
- If absolutely necessary, a custom firmware (for newer GoPros)

# TODO/help needed
- Better build system (with make)

# Thanks to

## Other
- Currently, I'm working with the Activeon DX, but I also have a Gopro Hero 3+.  
- Any help and/or questions are welcome.
