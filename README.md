# Ambarella Hack Development Kit
Unofficial documentation and hacks for Ambarella based cameras.  

[Extensive AmbaShell/Ambsh Documentation](ambsh.md)  
[Ambsh parser with preprocessor](src/main.c)  
[Code injection experiments](src/asm)  
[Cool Ambsh loader scripts](src/loader)  

# Goals
- Extensive Ambsh documentation
- Magic lantern like program (written in C)
- Quick introduction document to Ambarella software/hardware
- Ambsh interpreter/minimizer (with macros and stuff?) (parse/)
- If absolutely necessary, a custom firmware (for newer GoPros)

# Help Needed
- Better build system (with gnu make, linker)

# Thanks to
- http://spritesmods.com/?art=zx3hack&page=4 for the work done back in 2010.
- The entire Autoexec.ash/Ambarella hacking community.

## Other
- Currently, I'm working with the Activeon DX, but I also have a Gopro Hero 3+.  
- Any help and/or questions are welcome.
