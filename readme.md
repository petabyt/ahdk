# Ambarella Hack Development Kit
Unofficial documentation and hacks for Ambarella based cameras.  

In ambsh.md, you can find some information about the Ambsh programming language.  

In gen/, there is some code that generates autoexec.ash files that mess with  
the camera's memory.  

Currently, I'm working with the Activeon DX, but I also have a Gopro Hero 3+.  

Any help and/or questions are welcome.
